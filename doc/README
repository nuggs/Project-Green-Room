SocketMud

Little mud project, which has a command interpreter and supports
ANSI colors... has a nifty little help file system, and a few
commands (say, quit, who, etc). Also supports MCCP version 1 and 2.

I have used a few snippets of Erwin Andreasen's, so if you use this
codebase for something, remember to keep the credits to him, he
deserves it.

Simply type 'make' in the ../src/ directory, and start the mud
by typing './SocketMud &'. You can now connect by telnetting
to port 9009 on localhost (or whatever machine it runs on).

All parts of the SocketMud code written by me, that is contained
in this distribution, is considered public domain, and may be used
as you see fit - but do remember to give credit for Erwin's codebits,
even though they are considered PD as well.
